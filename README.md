### FFMPEG

An ffmpeg installation/binary is necessary to merge video and audio files of v.reddit videos.

On windows, it is necessary to have the binaries placed in the project root directory named `ffmpeg.exe`

On any other platform, it assumes you have ffmpeg installed and that it is possible to run ffmpeg from the shell.
